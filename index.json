Using a panel of European countries and state-dependent local projections, we document that cumulative fiscal multipliers are larger for countries in the EDP. That is, the procedure increases the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus. This result is mainly driven by decreasing interest rates and a substantial crowding-in of private investment in response to a positive fiscal spending shock. Multipliers in the EDP are even larger in bad times, indicating that the procedure is particularly effective under these circumstances. We show that being in the EDP is not simply a proxy for a weak fiscal position or a recessionary episode. In addition, we find that policy makers tend to underestimate fiscal multipliers in real time. The results suggest that the EDP is functional and that fiscal stimulus is an appropriate instrument to return on a path towards sustainable public finances for the countries in the procedure.","tags":["fiscal policy","fiscal multipliers","European Excessive Deficit Procedure","local projections"],"title":"The Effect of the European Excessive Deficit Procedure on Fiscal Spending Multipliers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Dovern","Christopher Zuber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601510400,"objectID":"6221cdece8ac231efa10acacfe1f2fbf","permalink":"https://christopherzuber.de/publication/dovernzuber-recessions-2020/","publishdate":"2019-05-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dovernzuber-recessions-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates expert revisions of potential output (PO) estimates following recessions. Using data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), we show that downward revisions are substantial, permanent, and mostly driven by supply shocks. In contrast, PO estimates do not significantly react to demand shocks. Revisions are also partly caused by mismeasurement of PO before recessions. In particular, we show that the length of the preceding boom and pre-recession values of the current account balance and credit volumes are correlated with post-recession PO revisions. Our results call for improved methods for estimating PO and provide evidence against the existence of substantial hysteresis following demand shocks.","tags":["potential output","trend","output gap","hysteresis","OECD"],"title":"Recessions and Potential Output: Disentangling Measurement Errors, Supply Shocks, and Hysteresis Effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Dovern","Christopher Zuber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"26e04fb6ae3483cb45f81eb4a9d611e6","permalink":"https://christopherzuber.de/publication/dovernzuber-how-2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dovernzuber-how-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Economic crises lead to lower potential output (PO) estimates, but little is known about which components of PO are revised. Our paper answers the questions of how much, how fast, and how persistently estimates of the capital stock, of trend labor, and of trend total factor productivity are revised downwards after major economic crises. It shows that revisions to different components of PO contributed equally to the substantial overall decline in estimated PO levels. Revisions of trend labor are predominantly driven by revisions of the NAWRU. The heterogeneity of revisions across EU countries after the Great Recession is large, suggesting that different policies are needed to bring countries back to their previous growth paths.","tags":["potential output","trend","output gap","Great Recession","European Commission"],"title":"How economic crises damage potential output â€“ Evidence from the Great Recession","type":"publication"}]
