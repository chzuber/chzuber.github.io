  abstract = {The Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) is the corrective arm of European fiscal governance. Using a panel of European countries and state-dependent local projections, we document that cumulative fiscal multipliers are larger for countries in the EDP. That is, the procedure increases the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus. This result is mainly driven by decreasing interest rates and a substantial crowding-in of private investment in response to a positive fiscal spending shock. Multipliers in the EDP are even larger in bad times, indicating that the procedure is particularly effective under these circumstances. We show that being in the EDP is not simply a proxy for a weak fiscal position or a recessionary episode. In addition, we find that policy makers tend to underestimate fiscal multipliers in real time. The results suggest that the EDP is functional and that fiscal stimulus is an appropriate instrument to return on a path towards sustainable public finances for the countries in the procedure.},
