  abstract = {The establishment of a special infrastructure fund with €500 billion in credit authorisation marks a political turning point in German investment policy. It is intended to address a long-standing investment backlog, particularly in the transport sector. However, critics see risks of a lack of additional funding and earmarking. The German Council of Economic Experts is calling for additional rules, including a minimum investment quota and long-term models for the fund. The decisive factor will be whether the extended scope for debt actually flows into future-oriented infrastructure projects.},
